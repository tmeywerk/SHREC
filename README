This is the SMT(LRA) learner SHREC, implementing SHREC1, SHREC2 and re-implementing INCAL.
For a quick start, execute "python3 bench.py path/to/smt/file ex seed", where path/to/smt/file is the path to a file in the smtlib format, ex is the number of examples you want to sample and seed is the random seed used for sampling.
To run all benchmarks at once, use the benchmarks.sh script.
Further documentation coming soon...
